Networking lab 2

To run this lab, run the paster server --reload development.ini on the command line then go to 127.0.0.1:5000/users/

You can add a userid off the command line by /users/:userid. You can also add users using the input form on the page. The users that get inputted have a userid, and an attribute field. Any users can be deleted and there is one large delete button at the bottom of the users table. Feel free to email me with any questions!!
